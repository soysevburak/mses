## To run this project follow the instructions given below:

### Please Note: Python 3.8.2 is needed to run this project

#### First Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/rishank-shah/Exam-Portal.git
cd Exam-Portal
```

#### Now we will need a .env file for storing email credentials
#### create .env in the Exam-Portal directory
#### Contents of .env file
```
export EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD_OF_EMAIL_ACCOUNT>
export EMAIL_HOST_USER=<EMAIL_ACCOUNT>
export EMAIL_HOST=<SMTP>
export DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<EMAIL_ACCOUNT>
```

#### If on Windows
##### Create a env.bat file with following contents 
```
set EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD_OF_EMAIL_ACCOUNT>
set EMAIL_HOST_USER=<EMAIL_ACCOUNT>
set EMAIL_HOST=<SMTP>
set DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<EMAIL_ACCOUNT>
```

#### After creating env file, run following commands:-
```
pip install pipenv
pip install django[argon2]
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```

source .env
```
#### If on windows
```
env.bat
```

#### After running commands as per OS run:
```
cd Exam
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

#### Once done with that create a superuser account:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### Once superuser account is created we can run the website

python manage.py runserver
```

#### If there are no errors website will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) (default)

#### For creating accounts for professor's we will need a group called Professor
